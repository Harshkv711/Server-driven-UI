# Server-Driven UI Example

This is a basic web application demonstrating the concept of Server-Driven UI (SDUI). SDUI is an approach where the server is responsible for generating and controlling the user interface of an application.

## Project Structure

- `app.js`: Node.js server file.
- `views/`: Directory containing EJS views.
  - `index.ejs`: Basic EJS template for rendering dynamic content.
- `public/`: Directory for static assets.
  - `styles.css`: Basic CSS stylesheet.
- `package.json`: Node.js project configuration file.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshkv711/sdui-example.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd sdui-example
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The server will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your browser to view the application.

## SDUI Concepts

- **Server-Driven UI (SDUI):** In this project, the server is responsible for rendering the UI components. Dynamic content is provided by the server, and the client only handles the presentation.

## Additional Steps (Optional)

- **Advanced Concepts:** Explore more advanced concepts such as database integration, authentication, real-time updates, and RESTful APIs as mentioned in the "Advanced Concepts" section of this README.
